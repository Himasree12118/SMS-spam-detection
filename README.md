# SMS-spam-detection
The number of people using mobile devices increasing day by day. SMS (short message service) is a text message service available in smartphones as well as basic phones. So, the traffic of SMS increased drastically. The spam messages also increased. The hackers try to send spam messages for their financial or business benefits like market growth, lottery ticket information, credit card information, etc. 
So, spam classification has special attention. In this paper, we applied various machine learning and deep learning techniques for SMS spam detection. we used a dataset to train the machine learning and deep learning models like LSTM and NB. The SMS spam collection data set is used for testing the method. The dataset is split into two categories for training and testing the research. Our experimental results have shown that our NB model outperforms previous models in spam detection with an accuracy of good. 
SMS Spam Detection is a machine learning model that takes an SMS as input and predicts whether the message is a spam or not spam message. The model is built using Python using pandas, numpy,  matplotlib.pyplot,  seaborn.
